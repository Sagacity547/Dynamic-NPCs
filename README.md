# Dynamic-NPCs

Itch Page to Web Build: https://juliand547.itch.io/dynamic-npcs

This project was mostly involved in the process of creating a Unity Developer Tool that could generate NPC's with different variables as Quest Givers for games. 
Gameplay is limited and is meant to display that NPC's dialogue change when their quests are undertaken by the player.
Please be sure to examine the gameplay video within this folder that shows off the NPC generator in action and code within the Assets subfolder
